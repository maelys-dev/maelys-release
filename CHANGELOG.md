# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-03

- `scripts/adopt.sh DIR [--apply|--check]`: writes the product's
  `release.yml` from the socle version it runs from, installs the
  maelys-release managed block in `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, the Claude
  skill and a `RELEASING.md` template; `--check` exits 2 on drift.
  `scripts/self-test.sh` exercises it and runs in the socle's CI with
  actionlint and shellcheck.
- `tap.yml` builds bottles on the macOS runners named by the `bottles`
  input, attests them, attaches them to the GitHub release and merges their
  digests into the formula before publishing it. The formula keeps its
  source URL.
- `docs/conventions.md`: versions and signed tags, dependency pins, packaging
  contract, formula naming (a command after its binary, a library with a
  `lib` prefix), open products with source plus bottles versus closed
  products with bottles only, runner and secret policies.
- `share/` texts are CC0-1.0 like maelys-cli's.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-09-02

- The tap workflow fails explicitly on an unrendered placeholder.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-02
